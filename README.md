# Tanita Data Format
The tanita measurement datafiles can be found in the `TANITA\GRAPHV1\DATA` directory with the name of `DATA1.CSV`...`DATA4.CSV` where each file corresponds to a slot (button) on the scale. Individual profile data can be found for users in `TANITA\GRAPHV1\SYSTEM` directory with the name of `PROF1.CSV`...`PROF4.CSV`.

Each measurement file is comma separated, where a given line indicates a measurement for a user in that slot. Instead of headers for the csv, each row has header information embeded in it, where column `i` is the header for the data field in column `i+1`. Each even column (0, 2, 3 ...) is a header, and headers are always two characters in length.
